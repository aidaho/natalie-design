Complex design project for a chain of convenience shops.

The main message of the updated brand is that everyone can find something for themselves here.
The shop contains a lot of different product groups, so it needed to be organized, clean and welcoming.
Another massage we wanted to convey is that it's smart to buy cheap.
We wanted to keep the bright and cheerful mood that the brand already had and used bright details and interesting communication elements.
