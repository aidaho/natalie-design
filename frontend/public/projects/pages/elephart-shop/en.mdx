The main direction of the brand is to help develop creativity, providing all the necessary resources.
In branding, we tried to convey the freedom and ease that accompanies the creative process. Therefore, we created a store character - an elephant flying on origami wings

The interior design uses bright colors and interesting patterns. Due to the wide variety of products, both factory and hand-made equipment were used. A unique element of the room are hand-made hanging origami clouds.

Created in partnership with Oleg Mochalkin
