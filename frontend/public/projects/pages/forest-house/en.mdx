An elegant light house with big windows to accentuate picturesque view.
The combination of shapes, colors, materials, and location creates a character of this home. The open floor plan creates a welcoming atmosphere that's ideal for entertaining guests or spending time with family or friends.
Forest Residence is a wonderful combination of stone, wood, and glass in the exterior. Wooden details and floors create a special comfort, while floor-to-ceiling windows provide natural light and warmth throughout the space. The game room will be your perfect spot to hang out with friends and family and have some fun. A home office with a separate entrance will be very comfortable for meeting your business guests.
