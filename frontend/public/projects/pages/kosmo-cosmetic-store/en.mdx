Kosmo - is one of the largest Ukrainian store chains in the beauty industry. The idea of the project was to change the client’s attitude towards the purchase of care products from "I need" to "I want".

The new format was supposed to be easy to scale, while at the same time being light and feminine.
Natural, up-to-date materials and soft colors, open display cases and convenient equipment for specific product groups, attractive advertising design and convenient navigation.

There are also integrated spaces for services that enhance customer care: makeup, a children's area, and a partner delivery service from Mist express.

Created in partnership with Oleg Mochalkin, Igor Stepanov
