A concept for a youth clothing brand in a shop-in-shop format.
The task is to make it convenient for placement in any space, so the concept included several options for planning solutions.
The brand's bold style is reflected in industrial materials, LED lamps and bright colors. Navigation is carried out using moving LED boards.

Created in partnership with Sicore Group.
