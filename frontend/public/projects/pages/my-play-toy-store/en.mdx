A comprehensive project that includes branding and design of a chain of stores.
The project aims to rethink the essence of a children's store as such, appealing to the child as a client, not just their parents. Therefore, the main goal of the store is to turn an ordinary visit to the store into a small adventure. It aspires to be an immersive haven of entertainment for the young ones.

A thoughtfully designed play area has been incorporated to provide an engaging and safe space for children to revel in boundless amusement while their parents partake in their shopping pursuits.

Product categories are divided according to children's talents and areas of development. Among the store's features of original design and construction are a stage for performances, points for testing of gadgets, a ball pool, a laser tunnel and others.

Created in partnership with Oleg Mochalkin, Igor Stepanov
