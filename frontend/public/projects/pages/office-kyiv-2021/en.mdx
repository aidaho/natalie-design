The concept of an office interior for an agricultural equipment company.
The goal was to create a welcoming place for the guests and a comfortable environment for the employees.
The entire studio space has the maximum open space planning, including conference rooms, creating a feeling of vitality and energy in the office while maintaining privacy in high focus areas. Glass partitions allow a lot of natural sunlight to enter the space.
The design of the premises is calm and concise, complemented with interesting industrial details that reflect the company's activities.
