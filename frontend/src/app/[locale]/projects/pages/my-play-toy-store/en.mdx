A comprehensive project that includes branding and design of a chain of stores.
The project aimed to rethink the essence of a children's store as such.
The customer of "My Play" Store is primarily the child, not his parents. Therefore, the main goal of the store is to turn an ordinary visit to the store into a small adventure.
